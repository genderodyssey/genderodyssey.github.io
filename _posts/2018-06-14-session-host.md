# Gender Odyssey Volunteer: Session Hosts

Thank you so much for volunteering to be a session host at Gender Odyssey this year.

The session hosts are essentially the hosts in the room, helping the smooth timely running of the scheduled workshops.

We look to you to:
- introduce the presenters and the workshop to the audience
- invite and assist the presenters/facilitators in any way they seek 
- assist the audience with anything they may need
- help keep the presenter on time by indicating the time left to them during the workshop
- close out the session with thank you notes to presenters, and make any other announcements
- pass out and collect evaluation forms (session feedback) to the audience for each session

You will be provided with:
- the script for introduction and any other announcements on the day for your ease. You could either go verbatim by the script or use it more as an aid.
- the details for where to procure any supplies the presenters want
- evaluation forms to give the audience
- signs to indicate time left to the presenter during the course of the session
- points of contact for any requirements or emergencies during the session

Do arrive ahead of time for your shift so you have time to find your room and run through the material and guidelines we will provide you. Throughout your time at the conference, remember to use non-gendered language as much as possible.

Thanks again for your support and energy. Have a good time.
