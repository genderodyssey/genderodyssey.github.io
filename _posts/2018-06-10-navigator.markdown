- Problem-solve any issues that may occur. Assist in creating solutions. Be flexible.

- Be an available and active connection between venue security and GO Staff/other volunteers

# **Be Intentionally Observant**

## Know Your Surroundings

Part of your role as a **Navigator** is to be aware and observant of overall surroundings, people, places, interactions and the “pulse” of the human “hive” of conference goers against a backdrop of the general public in a public space.

**Observe**, **recognize** and **identify** behaviors, interactions, people, clothing, objects that are/seem questionable, out- of-sync, nonsensical, irregular, make you take a second- look or take a pause. **Trust your instincts**. If appropriate, **investigate**, **check-in** and just generally **check-it-out**.

## Know Your Surroundings

* Familiarize yourself with the conference footpath and layout.
Know where the “kids camp”, the teen/tween space, family conference and general conference rooms are on the map.
- Locate the designated “quiet space” area.
- Locate all major restrooms, (know which are gender neutral or accommodate family/change space)] exits, stairs, elevators, escalators, water fountains and physical necessity accommodations: wheelchair access, ramps, and service animal access.

## Identify and Recognize Questionable Behaviors/Visible Signs

This is definitely subjective. Judgment concerning any person or behavior that might be/turn violent should be used with extreme caution and care.

Many of our attendees have reason to feel “stressed”, nervous, or show visible signs of anxiety. Many of us have rarely felt like we belong. Some are not comfortable being “out” in such a public space.

The goal is to recognize physical/verbal clues that might identify and predict any violent behavior/act, then to intercept the person before anything happens to stop any violent behavior/act.

When checking in with someone, look/listen for:
- No empathy shown
- Statements inconsistent with emotion displayed or emotionally bizarre
- Cold, penetrating stare
- Rendering/Describing people as less than/“nothuman”
- Stressed behaviors: avoiding eye contact, emotionally distant, surveilling, fidgeting,

## Identify and Recognize Out-of-Context Clothing or Objects

Again, much of this is subjective and an imperfect science. Consider that some of these items or pieces of clothing have a legitimate purpose. For instance attendees may be dressed in costume or fetish wear. Or could be “dressing” for the first time in public.

Look for:
● Unattended backpacks, boxes, bags
● People carrying backpacks, duffelbags, or luggage
● Clothing that doesn’t make sense for the occasion or temperature/season
● Clothing or bags that could conceivably store weapons

## In Case of Emergency
